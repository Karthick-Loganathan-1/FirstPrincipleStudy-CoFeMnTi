## 2. Structural Properties

### 2.1 Crystal Structure and Optimization
The CoFeMnTi quaternary Heusler alloy adopts the L2₁ structure (space group F-43m, No. 216) with face-centered cubic (FCC) symmetry. The atomic arrangement follows the Heusler prototype with:
- Fe occupying 4a Wyckoff positions (0,0,0)
- Co occupying 4b positions (0.5,0.5,0.5)  
- Mn occupying 4c positions (0.25,0.25,0.25)
- Ti occupying 4d positions (0.75,0.75,0.75)

### 2.2 Lattice Parameter Optimization
Variable-cell relaxation calculations yielded:
- **Equilibrium lattice parameter**: a = 10.958 bohr (5.80 Å)
- **Unit cell volume**: V = 48.84 Å³
- **Bulk modulus**: Derived from stress-strain relation during optimization
- **Lattice contraction**: 3.4% reduction from initial estimate (11.34 bohr)

The significant lattice contraction indicates strong covalent-metallic bonding character, consistent with the high calculated density of 7.40 g/cm³.

## 3. Electronic Structure

### 3.1 Total Density of States
The calculated total density of states exhibits characteristic metallic behavior with:
- **Fermi energy**: EF = 17.58 eV
- **DOS at Fermi level**: N(EF) ≈ 7.3 states/eV·cell
- **Spin asymmetry**: Pronounced difference between majority and minority spin channels
- **Electronic specific heat coefficient**: γ ≈ 1.7 mJ/mol·K² (estimated from N(EF))

### 3.2 Projected Density of States Analysis
Atomic-resolved PDOS calculations reveal the orbital character near the Fermi level:

**d-orbital contributions (states/eV·atom):**
- Fe d-states: 1.88 (dominant contributor)
- Mn d-states: 1.60 (significant contribution)
- Co d-states: 1.50 (moderate contribution)
- Ti d-states: 0.80 (smallest but non-negligible)

The electronic structure is dominated by transition metal d-orbitals, with substantial hybridization between neighboring atomic sites. The s-orbital contributions are minimal near EF, confirming the d-electron character typical of Heusler alloys.

### 3.3 Band Structure Analysis
Electronic band structure calculations along the high-symmetry path Γ→X→L→Γ demonstrate:
- **Metallic character**: Multiple bands cross the Fermi level
- **Band dispersion**: Significant electronic dispersion indicating good conductivity
- **Exchange splitting**: Clear evidence of spin-dependent band shifts due to magnetic exchange

### 5.2 Orbital-Resolved Magnetic Contributions
Analysis of the projected magnetic density reveals:
- **Mn d-orbitals**: Primary source of magnetic moment (high-spin d⁵)
